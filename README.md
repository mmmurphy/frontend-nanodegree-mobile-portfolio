## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

### What I Did to Optimize the performance

The original performance using Google Canary Developer Tools was 73%.  Making the
modifications outlined below, I am able to get the performance to 94%.  Performance
after optimizations using PageSpeed, shows 93% for mobile and 95% for Desktop.

There is room for further optimizations on the web server end that I am not amiable
to make for this test due to not having full access to the web server configuration.

#### index.html

* used imagemagick to convert pizzeria.jpg and profilepic.jpg to the webp format
* set rel="preload" attribute for page font
* added media="print" for the print.css stylesheet
* moved style.css to inline <style> element in
* minimize code

#### views/Pizza.HTML

* moved style.css to inline <style> element in html
* moved attribute css to <style> css
* converted pizzeria.jpg into smaller sized .webp images in 200, 400, 800, and 1200 widths
* used imagemagick to convert pizza.png to .webp format
* added script to load stylesheet bootstrap-grid.css after the page is loaded.
     found code sample at http://www.vidalquevedo.com/how-to-load-css-stylesheets-dynamically-with-jquery
* minimize code


#### views/js/main.js

* use pizza.webp
* line 529 - made loop max 20 for number of pizzas
* minimize code
